Subject: Data Quality Feedback and Next Steps for Data Volume Handeling

Hello,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some observations and questions based on the data analysis I’ve conducted for the Fetch Rewards data. This message outlines key data quality findings, how I discovered them, and steps we can take to improve data accuracy and performance as the data volume grows larger.

Key Questions and Observations:

How were the userFlaggedBarcode fields intended to be used, and what do empty or missing values indicate about user interactions?
Is the high presence of test data in the brands table intentional, or does it need to be excluded for more accurate analysis?


Through SQL queries and data profiling, we identified several key data quality issues:
Missing Barcodes: Many entries in the rewardsReceiptItems table are missing both barcode and userFlaggedBarcode.
Data Consistency Issues: Discrepancies between itemPrice and finalPrice were found without corresponding needsFetchReview flags.
Test Data Presence: We found a significant number of test entries in the brands table, which could skew analysis and performance.
Duplicate Records: The users table contained 495 total rows but only 212 unique entries, indicating a potential duplication issue.
What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?

Clarification on whether test data should be included in any production analysis.
Confirmation on how missing barcode values should be handled—should these records be flagged, excluded, or corrected?
Guidance on appropriate thresholds for data integrity checks (e.g., pricing mismatches).
What other information would you need to help optimize the data assets?

Access to a data dictionary or more detailed documentation on expected values and relationships between fields (e.g., how rewardsReceiptItems link to brands via barcode).
Clarification on the expected frequency and volume of data updates or changes, which can help fine-tune optimization strategies.
Performance and scaling concerns anticipated in production:

Data Volume and Indexing: As the volume of records increases, queries may slow down without optimized indexing. We plan to implement indices on frequently queried fields such as barcode and userId.
Duplicate Data Handling: Redundant data could slow down data retrieval and analysis. We recommend incorporating deduplication processes before data loads.
Data Quality Checks: Automating regular data integrity checks would ensure consistent, high-quality data for business analysis.
I’m happy to discuss these insights in more detail and collaborate on a plan to address these data quality issues comprehensively. Please let me know if you’d like to set up a meeting or if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,
